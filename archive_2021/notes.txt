attiribute = columns (independent data)
label = what we are guessing? (dependent data) --> from all the other attributes

Linear Regression (maths) => 
 - https://www.techwithtim.net/tutorials/machine-learning-python/linear-regression-2/
 - the best fit line according to the datapouints
 - u cannot visualize it as each feature accounts for 1 dimension thus more than 3 cannot be drawn
 - Equation: y = m*x+b
 	 - m is the slope. Meaning how much the y value increases for each x value.
 	 - b is the y intercept. Where the line cro
 	 sses the y axis.
